# The Sieve of Eratosthenes
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm for finding all the prime numbers leading up a limit n. 

The Jupyter notebook contains a function that takes any number as an input and uses the Sieve to output the number of primes within the limit as well as
a list of the primes themselves
